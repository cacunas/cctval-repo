===========

This repository consist on the source code produced with Geant4 toolkit on my practice on CCTVAL.

 The purpose of the current proyect ('t02') is to write a simple implementation of a scintillator
using the specs of the Prelude420 crystal (which datasheet is included on te repo for reference and
comparison with the performance showed on the program).

 At the current time of the update of this README, the program is working with a rudimentary implementation
of the physical spects of the crystal, and the recollection of data is performed by to sensors on the 
opposite extremes of the crystal. The physical layout its just a gun shooting gamma photons at 511 keV
to a 5-cm-long scintillator crystal with to sensor on its ends (it was intended to be on the left and right,
but with the visualization driver it was shown that in realiti they are in the top and the bottom).
